The custom jsp for the dockbar (view.jsp) should be applied when
the theme regionportalen-theme is used.

In the new theme this jsp should not be applied.

Hence, the file view.jsp has been renamed to "view_regionportalen_theme.jsp".

If the hook is used in a setting where the theme "regionportalen-theme" is used,
then rename the file "view_regionportalen_theme.jsp" to view.jsp
