The custom jsp (page.jsp) for the navigation taglib should be used
together with the new theme for regionportalen (rp-new-theme pr vgr-alfa-theme).

The jsp uses expando values for pages (layouts).
These expando values should be configured in the control panel (custom fields for page)
The instance values for each page is edited in the "Manage Pages" view.

When display style is set to "4" for navigation portlet - the extended view is shown.
This view shows descriptions for each page (expando value according to above).
Also, a css class is defined for each navigation item that translates to an icon in the theme (rp-new-theme).
